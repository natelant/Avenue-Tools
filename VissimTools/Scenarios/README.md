# Installation and Running Instructions

**Installing Requirements**

To install the required packages, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

**Running the Python File**

To run the Python file, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```
python error_summary.py
```
This will execute the `error_summary.py` file and generate the error summary Excel file based on the data in the `.results` folder.


**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues during installation or running the Python file, ensure that you have the correct version of Python installed and that the `pip` package manager is up to date. Additionally, verify that the project directory contains the `requirements.txt` file and the Python file you are trying to run.
